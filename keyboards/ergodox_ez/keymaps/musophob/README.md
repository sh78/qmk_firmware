# Objectives

- Be ergonomic. Balance workload across fingers. 
- Don't create significant anti-patterns. Expand upon default functionality
while maintaining a mnemonic or physical reference to the function as it would
be performed on default hardware. Feel proficient if stuck on a default board.
- Prevent any need for a mouse, even if an anti-pattern must be used
- Cater to Vim users
  - common/repetitive operations go on the home row
  - use Left-Down-Up-Right pattern
