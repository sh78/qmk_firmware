# Work In Progress ðŸš¨

# Features

- Kinesis-like space/backspace/enter/delete
- Dual-function Caps Lock (CTRL / ESC)
- Space-cadet shift keys
- Vim emulation layers for working with native text areas in macOS (OS X) and Linux (GNOME)
- Function/media/mouse layer
- Record and perform custom macros on the fly

# Objectives

- Be ergonomic. Balance workload across fingers. 
- Don't create significant anti-patterns. Expand upon default functionality
while maintaining a mnemonic or physical reference to the function as it would
be performed on default hardware. Feel proficient if stuck on a default board.
- Prevent any need for a mouse, even if an anti-pattern must be used
- Cater to Vim users
  - common/repetitive operations go on the home row
  - use Left-Down-Up-Right pattern
  - Sacrifice ability to repeat alphanumeric characters
    Other than arrows, `-`, `=`, and so on, there is usually a better to way to
    get somewhere than holding down, say, `j` (down).
